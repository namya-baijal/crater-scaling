## Impact Crater-Scaling
Impact 'Crater Scaling' is a method used to relate the size and shape of each impact crater to the properties of the impactor and target surface. 

The primary objective of this project is to test and improve the crater scaling method using recent improvements to numerical models of the impact cratering process and new spacecraft observations from the Moon. This will help improve the crater scaling relationships for so-called ‘complex’ craters within a size range of 10-200 km in diameter. This study is then extended to craters of larger sizes called 'peak ring basins'.

The crater scaling equations from the observational data are then compared with the numerical simulations generated using iSALE. 

Steps to run the python files and make comparisons to the simulations:
* Open the python script: 
> error_script.py
